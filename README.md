PISM, a Parallel Ice Sheet Model
================================

The Parallel Ice Sheet Model is an open source, parallel, high-resolution ice sheet model:

* hierarchy of available stress balances
* marine ice sheet physics, dynamic calving fronts
* polythermal, enthalpy-based conservation of energy scheme
* extensible coupling to atmospheric and ocean models
* verification and validation tools
* complete [documentation](http://www.pism-docs.org/) for users and developers
* uses [MPI](http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/) and [PETSc](http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as/) for parallel simulations
* reads and writes [CF-compliant](http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/) [NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files

PISM is jointly developed at the [University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF)](http://www.uaf.edu/) and the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/).  UAF developers are based in the [Glaciers Group](http://www.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/) at the [Geophysical Institute](http://www.gi.alaska.edu).  It is supported by NASA [Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction](http://map.nasa.gov/) grant #NNX13AM16G and NASA ROSES #NNX13AK27G.
