"""Implements a rudimentary logging system.  Messages are sent in client code via :func:`logError`, :func:`logMessage`, 
etc.  These messages are then forwarded to any loggers that have been previously registered with :func:`add_logger`.

A logger is either a function with signature::

  def myLogger(message,verbosity)

or a class that implements::

  def __call__(self, message, verbosity)

The string message is passed as ``message`` and verbosity is a standard PISM verbosity (an integer between 1-5).
The following aliases are available

  * ``PISM.logging.kError``
  * ``PISM.logging.kWarning``
  * ``PISM.logging.kMessage``
  * ``PISM.logging.kDebug``
  * ``PISM.logging.kPrattle``

which are listed in increasing verbosity.  Note that ``kError`` need not signify an error message, only a message with 
verbosity 1 that is ensured to be printed.  Conversely, ``kPrattle`` signifies a verbosity level 5 with messages that
rarely need to be displayed.

The default logger, :func:`print_logger`, simply passes the message along as a call to :cpp:func:`verbPrintf`.
See also the  :class:`CaptureLogger`, which saves logged messages into an attribute of an :file:`.nc` file.

The logging system does not log calls to verbPrintf directly.  In particular, calls to verbPrintf from within PISM's C++ 
code do not pass through the python-based logging system.
