//! PISM bed smoother, plus bed roughness parameterization, based on Schoof (2003).
/*!
This class both smooths the bed and computes coefficients for an approximation
to Schoof's \f$\theta\f$.  The factor \f$0\le \theta \le 1\f$ multiplies the diffusivity
in the theory of the effect of bed roughness in the SIA by Christian Schoof
(2003; *The effect of basal topography on ice sheet dynamics*) [\ref
Schoofbasaltopg2003].

For additional information on this class see page \ref bedrough.

The user of this class hands PISMBedSmoother an "original" topography, and it
is preprocessed to fill the smoothed topography `topgsmooth`, and the
coefficients in an approximation to \f$\theta\f$.  This is done by a call to 
`preprocess_bed()`.  The call requires the half-width of the smoothing square
(a distance in m), or the number of grid points in each direction in the
smoothing rectangle, and the Glen exponent.

The call to `preprocess_bed()` <b>must be repeated</b> any time the "original"
topography changes, for instance at the start of an IceModel run, or at a bed
deformation step in an IceModel run.

PISMBedSmoother then provides three major functionalities, all of which \e must
\e follow the call to `preprocess_bed()`:
-# User accesses public IceModelVec2S `topgsmooth`, the smoothed bed itself.
-# User asks `get_smoothed_thk()` for gridded values of the consistent smoothed
   version of the ice thickness, which is the thickness corresponding to a given
   surface elevation and the pre-computed smoothed bed.
-# User asks for gridded values of \f$\theta(h,x,y)\f$ using `get_theta()`.

Here is a basic example of the creation and usage of a PISMBedSmoother instance.
Note that PISMBedSmoother will update ghosted values in `topgsmooth`, and other
internal fields, and update them in the return fields `thksmooth`, `theta`,
if asked.  In IceModel::velocitySIAStaggered()
\code
    PISMBedSmoother smoother(grid, config, 2);
    const double n = 3.0,
                    lambda = 50.0e3;
    ierr = smoother.preprocess_bed(topg, n, lambda); CHKERRQ(ierr);
    ierr = smoother.get_smoothed_thk(usurf, thk, 1, &thksmooth); CHKERRQ(ierr);
    ierr = smoother.get_theta(usurf, n, 1, &theta); CHKERRQ(ierr);
\endcode
See IceGrid and PISMConfig documentation for initializing `grid` and
`config`.  Note we assume `topg`, `usurf`, `thk`, `thksmooth`, and `theta`
are all created IceModelVec2S instances.
