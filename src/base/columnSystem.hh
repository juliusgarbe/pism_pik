//! Virtual base class.  Abstracts a tridiagonal system to solve in a column of ice and/or bedrock.
/*!
Because both the age evolution and conservation of energy equations require us to set up
and solve a tridiagonal system of equations, this is structure is worth abstracting.

This base class just holds the tridiagonal system and the ability to
solve it, but does not insert entries into the relevant matrix locations.
Derived classes will actually set up instances of the system.

The sequence requires setting the column-independent (public) data members,
calling the initAllColumns() routine, and then setting up and solving
the system in each column.
