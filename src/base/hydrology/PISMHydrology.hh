//! \brief The PISM subglacial hydrology model interface.
/*!
This is a virtual base class.

The purpose of this class and its derived classes is to provide
\code
  subglacial_water_thickness(IceModelVec2S &result)
  subglacial_water_pressure(IceModelVec2S &result)
  till_water_thickness(IceModelVec2S &result)
\endcode
These correspond to state variables \f$W\f$, \f$P\f$, and \f$W_{\text{til}}\f$
in [\ref BuelervanPeltDRAFT], though not all derived classes of PISMHydrology
have all of them as state variables.

Additional modeled fields, for diagnostic purposes, are
\code
  overburden_pressure(IceModelVec2S &result)
  wall_melt(IceModelVec2S &result)
\endcode

This interface is appropriate to subglacial hydrology models which track a
two-dimensional water layer with a well-defined thickness and pressure at each
map-plane location.  The methods subglacial_water_thickness() and
subglacial_water_pressure() return amount and pressure.  This subglacial water
is *transportable*, that is, it moves along a modeled hydraulic head gradient.
Background references for such models include [\ref FlowersClarke2002_theory,
\ref Hewittetal2012, \ref Schoofetal2012, \ref Hewitt2013].

These models always have a separate, but potentially-coupled, amount of water
which is held in local till storage.  It is important to note that the
transportable water (bwat) and till water (tillwat) thicknesses are different.
Published models with till storage include [\ref BBssasliding, \ref SchoofTill,
\ref TrufferEchelmeyerHarrison2001, \ref Tulaczyketal2000b].

The till water thickness is can be used, via the theory of
[\ref Tulaczyketal2000], to compute an effective pressure for the water in the
pore spaces of the till, which can then be used by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion
to provide a yield stress.  Class PISMMohrCoulombYieldStress does this
calculation.  Here in PISMHydrology only the till water thickness tillwat is
computed.

PISMHydrology is a timestepping component (PISMComponent_TS).  Because of the
short physical timescales associated to liquid water moving under a glacier,
PISMHydrology (and derived) classes generally take many substeps in PISM's major
ice dynamics time steps.  Thus when an update() method in a PISMHydrology
class is called it will advance its internal time to the new goal t+dt
using its own internal time steps.

Generally PISMHydrology classes use the ice geometry, the basal melt
rate, and the basal sliding velocity in determining the evolution of the
hydrology state variables.  Note that the basal melt rate is an
energy-conservation-derived field and the basal-sliding velocity is derived
from the solution of a stress balance.  The basal melt rate and
sliding velocity fields therefore generally come from IceModel and
PISMStressBalance, respectively.

Additional, time-dependent and spatially-variable water input to the basal
layer, taken directly from a file, is possible too.

Ice geometry and energy fields are normally treated as constant in time
during the update() call for the interval [t,t+dt].  Thus the coupling is
one-way during the update() call.

It has no transportable water and subglacial_water_thickness() returns zero.

//! \brief A subglacial hydrology model which assumes water pressure
//! equals overburden pressure.
/*!
This is the minimal PISM hydrology model that has lateral motion of
subglacial water and which conserves the water mass.  It was promised
as a PISM addition in in Bueler's talk at IGS 2012 Fairbanks:
  http://www2.gi.alaska.edu/snowice/glaciers/iceflow/bueler-igs-fairbanks-june2012.pdf

The water velocity is along the steepest descent route for the hydraulic
potential.  This potential is (mostly) a function of ice sheet geometry,
because the water pressure is set to the overburden pressure, a simplified but
well-established model [\ref Shreve1972].  However, the water layer thickness
is also a part of the hydraulic potential because it is actually the potential
of the top of the water layer.

This (essential) model has been used for finding locations of subglacial lakes
[\ref Siegertetal2009, \ref Livingstoneetal2013TCD].  Subglacial lakes occur
at local minima of the hydraulic potential.  If water builds up significantly
(e.g. thickness of 10s of meters or more) then in the model here the resulting
lakes diffuse instead of becoming infinitely deep.  Thus we avoid delta
functions of water thickness at the minima of the hydraulic potential in this
well-posed model.

This model should generally be tested using static ice geometry first, i.e.
using option -no_mass.

Use option `-report_mass_accounting` to see stdout reports which balance the
books on this model.

The state space includes both the till water effective thickness \f$W_{til}\f$,
which is in PISMHydrology, and the transportable water layer thickness \f$W\f$.

For more complete modeling where the water pressure is determined by a
physical model for the opening and closing of cavities, and where the state
space includes a nontrivial pressure variable, see PISMDistributedHydrology.

There is an option `-hydrology_null_strip` `X` which produces a strip of
`X` km around the edge of the computational domain.  In that strip the water flow
velocity is set to zero.  The water amount is also reset to zero at the end
of each time step in this strip (in an accounted way).

As noted this is the minimal model which has a lateral water flux.  This flux is
    \f[ \mathbf{q} = - K \nabla \psi = \mathbf{V} W - D \nabla W \f]
where \f$\psi\f$ is the hydraulic potential
    \f[ \psi = P + \rho_w g (b + W). \f]
The generalized conductivity \f$K\f$ is nontrivial and it generally also
depends on the water thickness:
    \f[ K = k W^{\alpha-1} |\nabla (P+\rho_w g b)|^{\beta-2}. \f]

This model contains enough information (enough modeled fields) so that we can
compute the wall melt generated by dissipating the gravitational
potential energy in the moving, presumably turbulent, subglacial water.  If we
suppose that this heat is dissipated immediately as melt on the
cavity/conduit walls then we get a formula for a wall melt contribution.  (This
is in addition to the `bmelt` field coming from conserving energy in the flowing
ice.)  See wall_melt().  At this time the wall melt is diagnostic only and does
not add to the water amount W; such an addition is generally unstable.

//! \brief The PISM subglacial hydrology model for a distributed linked-cavity system.

This implements the new Bueler & van Pelt model documented at the repo (currently
private):
  https://github.com/bueler/hydrolakes
Unlike PISMRoutingHydrology, the water pressure P is a state variable, and there
are modeled mechanisms for cavity geometry evolution, including creep closure
and opening through sliding ("cavitation").  Because of cavitation, this model
needs access to a PISMStressBalance object.

In addition to the actions within the null strip taken by PISMRoutingHydrology,
this model also sets the staggered grid values of the gradient of the hydraulic
potential to zero if either regular grid neighbor is in the null strip.
