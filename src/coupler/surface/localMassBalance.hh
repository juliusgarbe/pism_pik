//! \brief Base class for a model which computes surface mass flux rate (ice
//! thickness per time) from precipitation and temperature.
/*!
  This is a process model.  At each spatial location, it uses a 1D array, with a
  time dimension, for the temperature used in melting snow or ice.  At each spatial
  location it assumes the precipitation is time-independent.

  This process model does not know its location on the ice sheet, but
  simply computes the surface mass balance from three quantities:
  - the time interval \f$[t,t+\Delta t]\f$,
  - time series of values of surface temperature at \f$N\f$ equally-spaced
  times in the time interval
  - a scalar precipation rate which is taken to apply in the time interval.

  This model also uses degree day factors passed-in in DegreeDayFactors `ddf`,
  and the standard deviation `pddStdDev`.  The latter is the standard deviation of the
  modeled temperature away from the input temperature time series which contains
  the part of location-dependent temperature cycle on the time interval.

  \note 
  \li Please avoid using config.get("...") and config.get_flag("...") calls
  inside those methods of this class which are called inside loops over 
  spatial grids.  Doing otherwise increases computational costs.
  \li This base class should be more general.  For instance, it could allow as
  input a time series for precipation rate.
