# This script uses the circular very similar to the one in
# run_noshelf.sh to confirm the issue #74
# (https://github.com/pism/pism/issues/74), i.e. that when -float_kill
# is used the sub-shelf ice flux reported by PISM (the
# sub_shelf_ice_flux variable) can be non-zero even when the total
# area of the floating ice (variable iareaf) is zero.

# This is due to the fact that during time-stepping the sub-shelf ice
# flux is computed before calving is applied. This error has an O(dt)
# character. This will be fixed once the 2D mass transport code gets
# an overhaul, but for now sub_shelf_ice_flux should be attributed to
# calving. (This is consistent with what the model does right now.)
