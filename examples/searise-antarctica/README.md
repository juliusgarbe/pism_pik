Antarctica example using SeaRISE-Antarctica data
=========

The scripts in this directory apply the PISM model to the present-day Antarctic
ice sheet.  The data are from the SeaRISE collaboration, specifically the file
`Antarctica_5km_dev1.0.nc` (105 MB) described at
<http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/Present_Day_Antarctica>.

These scripts do not prepare an actual SeaRISE submission.  Some elements of the
modeling strategy in this example is explained in

* M. A. Martin, R. Winkelmann, M. Haseloff, T. Albrecht, E. Bueler, C. Khroulev, A. Levermann (2011).  _The Potsdam Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM-PIK) - Part 2: Dynamic equilibrium simulation of the Antarctic ice sheet_, **The Cryosphere** 5, 727--740. <http://www.the-cryosphere.net/5/727/2011/tc-5-727-2011.pdf>

Getting and preprocessing the data
---------

This script downloads `Antarctica_5km_dev1.0.nc` with `wget` and uses NCO to
preprocess to PISM-ready condition:

    $ ./preprocess.sh

Running the example spinup
---------

Next look at the script which would run (i.e. a dry-run):

    $ PISM_DO=echo ./antspinCC.sh N | less 

Then actually do the run in the background, saving its `stdout` output in a
file; this will take a number of processor-hours:

    $ ./antspinCC.sh N &> out.ant30km &

This is a 30 km grid run with N processes.  The first
stage essentially smooths the surface, the second stage improves the enthalpy
field, and then the third stage uses the "full" physics.  (I.e. sliding plus
PIK calving front physics).

Higher-resolution runs can be achieved by modifying the script; reset the `GRID`
and `SKIP` variables.  Different parameter values can be set also.

SeaRISE experiments
---------

To perform the actual SeaRISE experiments, see scripts in PISM release `stable0.4`.
Look in `examples/searise-antarctica`.  These scripts will require modifications
to run under more recent versions of PISM.
